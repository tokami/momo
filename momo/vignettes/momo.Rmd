The goal of momo is to offer a flexible and fast model that can estimate habitat
preferences and fine-scale movement patterns based on tagging data.


## *Tagging data*

A data set containing all required information can quickly be created by the
function `sim.momo`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Simulate a data set with tagging data
sim <- sim.momo()
```



## *Fitting momo*

The main function to estimate movement paramters is `fit.momo`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Fit the movement model
fit <- fit.momo(sim)
```



## *Inspecting results*

The package includes a variety of functions that allows to inspect the results:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Plot the results
plotmomo.compare(sim = sim, fit = fit)
```
