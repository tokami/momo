momo is a new R package for tagging-based **mo**vement **mo**deling,
specifically designed to estimate fine-scale animal movement patterns
using various tagging data, such as mark-recapture, mark-resight, and
data-logging/archival tags. The movement model is based on the
advection-diffusion equation and incorporates habitat preference
functions, enabling the reconstruction of individual movement paths and
inference of population-level movement dynamics using a small set of
interpretable parameters. Movement rates are estimated as a function of
environmental conditions or geographic locations.
